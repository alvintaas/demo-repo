I watched the tutorial about "Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course" by freeCodeCamp via the link - https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk?si=bRMg6G1isxMoWjS0

Below is a log and journal of the things learnt from the tutorial:

23.12.30 - Learnt how to generate SSH keys, and how to connect it with my github account
24.01.02 - Playing with SSH keys. It's confusing, but will get better at it's use by continuing to push through
         - Created another repo called demo-repo2, using terminal to connect and push local files to github 
24.01.05 - Getting back into the swing of things
24.01.06 - More practising with git controls. Extra push for coloring
24.01.07 - More practice
24.01.08 - Started on Front End Development Libraries on freeCodeCamp
24.01.10 - Learning Bootstrap and jQuery on freeCodeCamp
24.01.11 - Completed jQuery. Intuitive, and incredibly useful in standardizing javascript. Looking into Sass now
         - Dunno what it was, but Sass was harder to get a grasp than I thought it would be
