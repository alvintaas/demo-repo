I watched the tutorial about "Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course" by freeCodeCamp via the link - https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk?si=bRMg6G1isxMoWjS0

Below is a log and journal of the things learnt from the tutorial:

23.12.30 - Learnt how to generate SSH keys, and how to connect it with my github account
24.01.02 - Playing with SSH keys. It's confusing, but will get better at it's use by continuing to push through
         - Created another repo called demo-repo2, using terminal to connect and push local files to github 
24.01.05 - Getting back into the swing of things.
