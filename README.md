Wise words from a Senior Developer, passing down what was taught to them so many moons ago:

Ok SO, my advice on this isn’t as good as it used to be because, not to blow my own horn, I am now a senior-level engineer and my job is thus more-or-less safe irrespective of whatever’s going on in the market and thus I pay less attention to it than I used to. 

I say this because I want to give good advice - I got a lot of good advice when I was starting out and it really helped me so I want to pass it along. So maybe check with someone else as well but I think this is more or less correct. 

This will be a bit long but please send it all to him - you can even give him my email or fb and I'll be happy to set him up with some resources if he ends up getting serious.

OK, so when I started out I spent approximately one year (slightly less) learning how to program properly. I was working full-time concurrently but I didn't have a "career" job. If you recall I quit my career job and took office peon gigs and so on so I could focus as much time as possible on programming. This is important: you cannot play around, programming is hard, especially if you don't already have a background (most of the really good engineers I know grew up messing around with computers with their brothers, always their older brothers). You can do it in one year IF you really spend at least four hours a day on average sitting at a computer and programming (I usually did one long day on a weekend to catch up from shorter weekdays). This will get you to "junior" status, probably earning between $50k-$70k in an entry-level position. SOME people find that they're talented, I've heard of people teaching themselves how to code in six months but it's rare. The good news is in my experience people who went to university to learn coding aren't really any better that self-taught people. It really comes down to:

- Can you handle sitting at a computer and working on problems for hours on end?
- Do you take the effort to learn what you don't know without having your hand held through it?

Some notes on the market at the moment:

It's a good time to be a senior, it's a tricky time to be a junior. The good news is there are a lot of jobs going around. The bad news is that people are tired of crap juniors swamping the market and asking for ludicrous money for their skills because they heard that programming is a goldmine. You WILL NOT earn a lot of money out of the gate. After two-three years your wage will bump to maybe $80k-$90k, after five years $120k and up depending on how good you are, all not inclusive of super. 

What to learn:

You'll have two main thrusts in your learning to get you ready for an entry-level job:

1. Projects. This is really the most important thing. Get yourself a github (something like a social network for coders where you post your code) and start making things. This is what makes the uni graduates so bad at coding - they don't do this so they have no idea of the actual workflows involved. Every place I've worked at, and in our hiring now we don't even look at uni, we look at what the person has actually produced in their portfolio. Make a thing, post it publicly somewhere, rinse and repeat until you get hired. 
2. Some basic computer science principles. I recommend Harvard CS50x, it's a free online course the university provides that should teach you everything you need to know to get from zero to I-know-something-about-computers. The learning curve is steep but it's designed for people who come in knowing nothing. 

Having both of those under your belt will help you vs other juniors entering the market because the vast majority have either one or the other.

Career progression:

As an engineer, as above the progression is something like this:

1. Junior - 0-2yrs - $50k-$70k - You will be in a team most likely and managed by a senior. You'll squash bugs and do simple features. Most likely you'll keep doing your side projects to build your skills or you'll be stuck in junior-forever mode.
2. Mid - 2-5yrs - $80k-$100k - You'll start working on some interesting stuff at work and can relax a little. 
3. Senior - 5yrs+ - $120k and up - You never actually stop learning new things but this is where it really gets nice. You will lead teams, you can split off and build your own business, people will compete to poach you rather than you having to look for jobs. You are suddenly the attractive prospect at every party.

One note on this: a valid career path is to get to mid-ish level and then transition into a business roll like project manager or product manager. This is a really great option for the non "born-engineers" because the pay is better, you don't have to work as hard and, most importantly, if you're a product manager or project manager with some technical skills you will get preferential hiring over the pure business people and the engineers you manage will adore you. It's a great career path if you really like the business side more than the pure coding.

Soft Skills

Get some familiarity with "scrum" and "agile", they are product development and project management processes that everyone uses. If you are a junior and you know at least something about this, it will help you get a leg up.
